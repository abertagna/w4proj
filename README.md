# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This repository contains the R code used to complete the Project Assignment for Getting and Cleaning Data course.

All the code is contained in only one script:
* run_analysis.R

To work properly, the script must be sourced in R when the working directory contains the input data of the exercise. The input data can be downloaded from [this link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). The working directory shall then be set to "UCI HAR Dataset" after unzipping the downloaded archive.

The output of the script is a text file containing the required data set according to the Course Project specifications
* dt.summary.txt
